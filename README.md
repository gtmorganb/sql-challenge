# sql-challenge

This challenge was a nice breath of fresh air from python. It was nice to start over with a lanuage and felt simpler in many ways. 

The data engineering portion was the most conceptually challenging. In this portion of the assignment, I was able to make foreign keys and primary keys for each of the datasets in order to build ways for them to connect. Engineering the data in a meaningful way makes analysis fast and clear. 

The primary key is determined by looking at which columns or data points the csv's have in common. For most of them, it was the employee number. And for a couple it was the department number. 

Once the data is set up into an ERD, analysis begins. 

The data analysis portion of this assignment involved pulling columns from different tables. This is done by joining the tables together based on a common column. A few of the analyses involved pulling the columns in only for certain criteria. To pull in only certain criteria, the where function is used to find data where a certain input is true.
